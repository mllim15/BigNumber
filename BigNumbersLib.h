 * @version 1
 *
 * @brief This library was created for CS2560 Final Part 2, and will
 * expand primitive data types and allow users to store big numbers that can
 * store up to 1,00 digits long. In order to do this, a BigNumbers class
 * will be created using TDD, that will use vectors from STL to store the digits.
 * BigNumbers should have the same functionality as other numerical data types.
